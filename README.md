Welcome to Cowardcoin!
This bot was something I started working on in my spare time, then I realised I could make it into my Computer Science A-Level NEA, which I did!
(ignore that it's almost 2 months past the due date)
(please)



Run makefile.py to get started - if you have no experience with discord bots, it'll guide you through every step. if you have experience, it'll just ask for all the numbers + tokens it needs. :)
