# Welcome to Cowardcoin!

**This bot was something I started working on in my spare time, then I realised I could make it into my Computer Science A-Level NEA, so I did!**

Required Libraries for Python 3.9:
```
- discord.py
- dotenv
```


Run extra programs\makefile.py to get started - if you have no experience with discord bots, it'll guide you through every step. if you have experience, it'll just ask for all the numbers + tokens it needs. :)

If you want to confuse your friends, run extraprograms\sendmessage.py! it'll let you send any message you want as the bot :)
