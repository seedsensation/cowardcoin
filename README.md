# Welcome to Cowardcoin!

Required Libraries for Python 3.9:
```
- discord.py
- dotenv
```

Roadmap, in order of priority:
1. give coin - allows users to give coins to each other - COMPLETE
2. betting implementation
3. make cowardcoin able to run in any server simply using an invite link in the readme.md

Run extra programs\makefile.py to get started - if you have no experience with discord bots, it'll guide you through every step. if you have experience, it'll just ask for all the numbers + tokens it needs. :)

If you want to confuse your friends, run extraprograms\sendmessage.py! it'll let you send any message you want as the bot :)
