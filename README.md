Welcome to Cowardcoin!
This bot was something I started working on in my spare time, then I realised I could make it into my Computer Science A-Level NEA, which I did!

(ignore that it's almost 2 months past the due date)

(please)

Required Libraries for Python 3.9: (i'm not sure which of these come with python, so i'll just list all of them)

os

asyncio

logging

discord

dotenv

random

time

math



Run makefile.py to get started - if you have no experience with discord bots, it'll guide you through every step. if you have experience, it'll just ask for all the numbers + tokens it needs. :)

If you want to confuse your friends, run sendmessage.py! it'll let you send any message you want as the bot :)
