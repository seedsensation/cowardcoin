i am EXTREMELY bad at using git.
ive learned most of this in my own time over the last week from random tutorials and i mean. it's . not going great.
i still don't understand rebase
i also dont understand how i lost all progress on the betting branch on github despite not pushing it
well. im just leaving this disclaimer here in case anyone even sees this
